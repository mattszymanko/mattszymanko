**Hey there! ðŸ˜Š Welcome to my GitHub profile!**

I'm Matt, an IT student and a developer. I'm currently studying Information Technology at [IUBH](https://www.iubh-international.com/) in Berlin. I associate my future with the IT sector, hoping to become a full stack developer one day.

I've been programming for a few years - It all started when I first learned HTML. Soon after I learned JavaScript, CSS and Node.js. I have been doing some small projects from the very beginning, however after starting my IT studies I decided to make a Discord bot using TS. After all, I've been using it for a couple of years and that would definitely help my knowledge.

For now, I program for my own satisfaction and help to others, but in the future I will probably deal with it for real. I've done minor open-source projects, websites for friends, and a Discord bot. If you need anything - I'll try to help. :)

I post all of my projects here, of course I am not working on all of them anymore.


If you want to contact me elsewhere, perhaps just find me on a different platform, I recommend that you look-up here:
